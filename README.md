Programming assignment for Stanford CS143 compilers course

The programming assignments are in `assignment` directory. Notice although I saved my answers here, I did not actually run them in this directory. Instead, I use the official VM with development environment preinstalled. I basically copied the code to the VM and run it there. The VM has slightly different file structures in the `assignment` directory.
